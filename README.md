Leaf Care is a Fruit Plant Disease Recognition Application. It is a smartphone application that can detect diseases in a fruit plant from a leaf image of the plant. The Application uses a custom-built, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network, that is integrated into the application. 

#Convolutional Neural Network
Leaf Care utilizes a lightweight convolutional neural network that is embedded in the mobile app. The CNN is trained on datasets of five fruits:
1. Apple
2. Banana
3. Corn
4. Citrus
5. Tomato
